Hope this helps. IDK how we will interface betweeen us though.

1.   Do the various predicting factors which have been chosen initially really 
affect the Life expectancy? What are the predicting variables actually affecting 
life expectancy?

Reginald: find and compile factor data
Maria: Calculate calculation coefficients of factors
Lisa: Chart various correaltion coefficients


2.   Should a country having a lower life expectancy value(<65) increase its 
healthcare expenditure in order to improve its average lifespan?

Reginald: Funny Flow Chart   Spend more YES NO if YES :) or :|, if NO :( or :|


3. Statistical test for Life Expectamcy based on Status *Maria

Reginald: compile status data
Maria: Do statistical tests
Lisa: Visuals for the test


5.   What is the impact of schooling on the life expectancy?

Reginald: compile schooling data
Maria: Schooling aggregation
Lisa: Plotting aggregated le data


6.   Does Life Expectancy have a positive or negative relationship with 
drinking alcohol?

Reginald: compile alcohol data
Maria: Do statistical tests
Lisa: Visuals for the test


7.   Do densely populated countries tend to have lower life expectancy?

Reginald: compile population data
Maria: population aggregation
Lisa: Plotting aggregated le data


8.   What is the impact of Immunization coverage on Life Expectancy?

Reginald: compile vax data
Maria: vax aggregation
Lisa: Plotting aggregated le data

REGINALD's job is to make this:
pd.DataFrame({
    "Country",
    "Developed (True/False)", //
    "Life Expectancy (Years)",
    "Population (Millions)",
    "GDP Per Capita (USD)",
    "Healthcare Spending (Millions Of USD)",
    "Alcohol",
    "Vaccination1 Rate (Percent Of Pop)",
})
