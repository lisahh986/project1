INSPIRATIONS
8 inspirations : Inspiration:
1.   Does various predicting factors which has been chosen initially really 
affect the Life expectancy? What are the predicting variables actually affecting 
life expectancy?
2.   Should a country having a lower life expectancy value(<65) increase its 
healthcare expenditure in order to improve its average lifespan?
//
3.   How does Infant and Adult mortality rates affect life expectancy?
4.   Does Life Expectancy has positive or negative correlation with eating 
habits, lifestyle, exercise, smoking, drinking alcohol etc.
5.   What is the impact of schooling on the lifespan of humans?
6.   Does Life Expectancy have a positive or negative relationship with 
drinking alcohol?
7.   Do densely populated countries tend to have lower life expectancy?
8.   What is the impact of Immunization coverage on Life Expectancy?
