This is our Life Expectancy Data Analytics Project!

We set out to answer 6 key questions regarding Life Expectancy.

1. How is life expectancy in a country affected by Alcohol Consumption, GDP, Population, Vaccination DTP, Vaccination Measles and, Health Spending?

2. Do countries with higher GDPs have higher life expectancies? 

3. Should a country having a lower life expectancy value(<65) increase its 
healthcare expenditure in order to improve its average lifespan? 

4. Does Life Expectancy have a positive or negative relationship with 
drinking alcohol?

5. Do densely populated countries tend to have lower life expectancy?

6. What is the impact of Immunization coverage has on Life Expectancy?

-------------------------
We combined data from the The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) for use in our analysis.
you can find these data at:
Life Expectancy: https://data.oecd.org/healthstat/life-expectancy-at-birth.htm,
Alcohol Consumption: https://data.oecd.org/healthrisk/alcohol-consumption.htm, 
GDP: https://data.oecd.org/gdp/gross-domestic-product-gdp.htm, 
Population: https://data.oecd.org/pop/population.htm, 
Youth Vaccination: https://data.oecd.org/healthcare/child-vaccination-rates.htm, 
Health Spending: https://data.oecd.org/healthres/health-spending.htm
-------------------------

Do countries with higher GDPs have higher life expectancies? 
Stats- Correlation: 62%; Max: ; Min: ; Median: ; Mean:
Based on our data it appears that aa higher gdp is correlated with a higher life expectancy

Should a country having a lower life expectancy value(<65) increase its 
healthcare expenditure in order to improve its average lifespan? 
Stats- Correlation: 62%; Max: ; Min: ; Median: ; Mean:
In general more spending on healthcare has a net positive affect. Our data suggests that countries with low life expectancies tedn to benefit more\notmuch more from increased healthcare spending.

Does Life Expectancy have a positive or negative relationship with 
drinking alcohol?
Stats- Correlation: 15%; Max: ; Min: ; Median: ; Mean:
Our data indicates a slight positive correlation between alcohol sales and life expectancy.

Do densely populated countries tend to have lower life expectancy?
Stats- Correlation: 15%; Max: ; Min: ; Median: ; Mean:

What is the impact of Immunization coverage has on Life Expectancy?
Stats- Correlation: DTP 42%, Measles 34%; Max: ; Min: ; Median: ; Mean:
